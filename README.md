## dictionary

### Requirement
* jdk12+
* google-guava library

### Installation/Running instructions
java -cp ./guava-30.1-jre.jar: DictionaryLauncher 

### Future improvements
Implement WordMap so that the dictionary preserve the order of insertion. Or make sure certain word types are always displayed first. (priority in definitions)
Currently Hashmap or Multimap does not preserve order and have to use sort function in order to keep it uniform in displaying the entries.
